Notes :
	1.- I built first the school.php part. Later, when I started bulding the administration.php part I decided to
	make it using a more complete MVC pattern.
	
	2.- The role levels are: 'admin', 'manager' and 'seller'.

	3.- The password for all team members is: 1234.

	4.- I preffered spending time with php/mysql programming rather than CSS issues.


Thank you for your attention.
